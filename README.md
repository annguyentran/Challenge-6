# Weather DashBoard 

This is a weather dashboard app that uses the openweatherapi to get the current weather and the weather for the next 5 days of the city that us searched.
When searching for a city, the user get the current city name, date, temperature in fahrenheit, Humidity, and the UV index with a background color indicating whether
the UV will be harmful or not. Below the current weather, we can see the weather displayed for the next 5 days with all of the information as the current except for the
UV index. The user's search will be added to the recent search history below the search button should the user want to search the same city again 
and up to 5 cities can be saved at a time.
